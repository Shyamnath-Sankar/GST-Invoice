# GST-Invoice

GST accounting for Dev Caters, Trichy — rebuilt as a single Next.js application for Vercel, with Neon Postgres and Neon Object Storage.

Record sales and purchase bills, check input tax credit against GSTR-2B, prepare GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B every month, and print or download the papers as PDF, Excel, CSV or JSON.

> **Documentation & User Guide:** For a complete walkthrough on using the application, see the [User Manual](docs/USER_MANUAL.md).

## What it is

- **One app.** Next.js (App Router, TypeScript) serves both the screens and the `/api` routes. No separate Python service.
- **Neon Postgres.** All data, including sessions and the audit log.
- **Neon Object Storage.** Bill photos and supplier PDFs are attached to a sale or purchase and kept in a private bucket.
- **Vercel.** Deployed as a standard Next.js project.
- **Plain UI.** White background, system fonts, ordinary forms and tables. No theme, no tour, no animation.
- **PDF output.** Invoices, credit/debit notes, returns and reports are generated as PDF on demand. Generated files are streamed, not stored; only files you attach yourself are kept.

## Planned stack

- Next.js App Router, React 19, TypeScript strict
- Drizzle ORM + `postgres` driver, Neon Postgres
- Neon Object Storage (S3-compatible) via `@aws-sdk/client-s3`
- Cookie sessions, bcrypt password hashes
- PDFKit, ExcelJS, `csv-parse`, `fflate`, Zod
- Vitest + PGlite for tests
- One hand-written stylesheet

## Local setup (after implementation)

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local     # set DATABASE_URL and the storage keys
npm run db:push
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. The first visit asks for the owner's account.

## Deploy

1. Create a Neon project and copy the **pooled** connection string.
2. Create a private object storage bucket (the project uses `gst-documents`).
3. Import this repository in Vercel and add `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`,
   `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, `S3_BUCKET`.
4. Run `npm run db:push` once against Neon (locally or in the build step).
5. Deploy.

See `docs/spec.md` for the full design and `docs/plan.md` for the build plan.
